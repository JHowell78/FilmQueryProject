## Week : 7 Project for Skill Distillery Java Bootcamp

### Film Query

This was our first introduction pulling data from a MySQL database.  I built a program that allows the user to search through the movie database using a film ID or any keyword.  When the program is loaded the user has three options (Search by Id, Search by keyword, or Exit). Searching by ID will only return the one film that matches the ID. Searching by keywords will return any and all films that contain the keyword in the title.  Both queries will return the film title, the year it was made, the MPAA rating, a synopsis of the plot, the films spoken language, and a list of the cast.


### New Techniques Used

* MYSql Database Queries and SQL Statements
* Static Initializer Blocks
* Try/Catch Blocks
* Exceptions

### Technologies Used

* Eclipse
* Git
* Atom
* Command line/terminal
* MYSql database
* Maven

### Plan of Attack

The first thing was learning what information I needed to retrieve from the SQL database.  Once I figured out that I had to correlate that to the names in the database so I could get the right data from the correct place. The most difficult part for my was getting all the cast members for the films it was only returning one at first.
